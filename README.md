                               ## Reflection

1. **What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?**
I challeneged some text colors that didn’t have enough contrast against their backgrounds, making them hard to read. I fixed that by choosing darker text on light backgrounds to meet WCAG contrast guidelines. I also added meaningful alt text to every image so screen-reader users would understand their purpose.

2. **How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?**
I used flexible layouts (Flexbox) and relative units (like % and rem) so the site adapts to different screen sizes. For accessibility, I made sure all interactive elements—links, buttons, form fields—could be reached and operated by keyboard alone, and I tested with a screen reader to confirm the reading order made sense.

3. **What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?**
I got and used these couple of tools while doing it:
W3c: as primary references for best practices of standards & accessibility issues.
WebAIM Contrast Checker: to verify text-to-background color contrast ratios.
Wave Accessibility Tool: for visualizing missing alt text or ARIA issues.
